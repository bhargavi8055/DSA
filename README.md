***************************************Patterns***************************************
Patterns is all about loops specially nested loops are included in most of the patterns.

  1. Outer loop is specifically for rows and inner loop is specifically for columns
  2. For the Outer loop, count the no of rows/lines.
  3. For the inner loop, focus on the columns and somehow connect them to the rows.
  4. Print them inside the inner loop.
  5. Observe Symmetry for some patterns (applicable to certain patterns only not for all patterns).
